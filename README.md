# cocp-carcassonne-project-post-processing
Post-processing code and dzn files for the Carcassonne project for the Combinatorial Optimization and Constraint Programming course.

Read user_manual.pdf to get more information about how to use these resources.

The original post processor code is in post_processor.py, while Team 18 has also included their own version of the post processor in the repo with slight changes for further reference.
