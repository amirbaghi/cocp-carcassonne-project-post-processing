# cocp-carcassonne-project-post-processing
Post-processing code for the Carcassonne project for the Combinatorial Optimization and Constraint Programming course.

The original post processor code is written in post_processor.py, while each of the involved teams (Team 7 and 18) have also included their own versions of the post processor in the repo with slight changes for further reference.
